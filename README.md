# calculator

see live: https://waltvenditti.github.io/calculator/

This project was assigned by The Odin Project in the Foundations course. It comes at the end of the JavaScript section, which itself comes after the HTML and CSS sections, so this project was a combination of the fundamentals. The code for the calculator itself was easy, though I had some difficulties with eventListeners occasionally firing twice when listening for keyboard inputs.
