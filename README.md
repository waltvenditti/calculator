# calculator

Although hardly the most challening of projects, I've included this one in my pins because I like it's styling. Some of my other projects are on the plain side and viewing them might leave you with the idea that I am totally hopeless when it comes to style. Which I still may be, depending on what you think of the calculator... 

The project itself was assigned by The Odin Project in the Foundations course. It comes at the end of the JavaScript section, which itself comes after the HTML and CSS sections, so this project was a combination of the fundamentals. The code for the calculator itself was easy, though I had some difficulties with eventListeners occasionally firing twice when listening for keyboard inputs.
